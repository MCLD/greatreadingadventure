# GRA Developer Documentation - Initial developer setup

## Development environment

- Windows, macOS: [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/)
- Linux, macOS, Windows: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Ensure you [install the C# extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/runtimes/dotnet)

## Initial developer setup

The project ships with the Microsoft SQL Server data provider configured. If you are running in a Windows environment this will automatically use a [LocalDB](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh510202.aspx) instance under `(localdb)\mssqllocaldb`. **In a Linux/macOS environment you should switch to the SQLite provider (in `appsettings.json` change the `GraConnectionStringName` to "SQLite"). You may need to eliminate all migrations and create one master migration, the SQLite provider does not support all of the operations necessary to support our incremental migrations.**

### Database migration

Initial database setup and configuration can be done utilizing the [`dotnet ef`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/cli/dotnet) command line tool or the [Package Manager Console](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/cli/powershell).

Connection strings for creating migrations are located in the `GRA.Development` namespace and mirror the definitions in the default `appsettings.json` file.

Here are steps for using `dotnet ef`:

1. Navigate to the appropriate project directory for your database provider (e.g. `src/GRA.Data.SqlServer` or `src/GRA.Data.SQLite`).
2. See a list of existing migrations:


    dotnet ef -s ../GRA.Web migrations list

3. Add a new migration for development:


    dotnet ef -s ../GRA.Web migrations add develop

4. Create or update the database to the migration (necessary for SQLite, possibly not for SQL Server but won't hurt):


    dotnet ef -s ../GRA.Web database update

Here are steps for using the Package Manager Console:

1. Choose the appropriate project from the "Default project" drop-down (e.g. `src/GRA.Data.SqlServer` or `src/GRA.Data.SQLite`).
2. Check if a database migration exists by looking for a folder named "Migrations" in the appropriate GRA.Data project.
3. Add a new migration for development:

   Add-Migration develop

4. Create or update the database to the migration (necessary for SQLite, possibly not for SQL Server but won't hurt):

   Update-Database

Please remove any non-release migrations when contributing code back to the project.

### Configuration

During development, User Secrets are the easiest way to customize the configuration without the risk of committing sensitive data to a source control repository. One key setting you may want to configure is `GraEmailOverride`. You can do that by right-clicking on the "GRA.Web" project and choosing "Manage User Secrets." Configure the `secrets.json` like this:

```json
{
  "GraEmailOverride": "your@email.address"
}
```

This will ensure that no errant emails are sent out during development. There are other settings you may want to configure through this manner such as `GraDefaultOutgoingMailHost` and `GraDefaultOutgoingMailPort`. Review [the documentation](http://manual.greatreadingadventure.com/en/latest/technical/appsettings/) for more configuration settings.

### Run the application!

At this point you should be able to run the application in the debugger.
