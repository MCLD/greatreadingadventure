# GRA Developer Documentation

## Environment

GRA code should successfully compile using the free [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) edition. External dependencies are managed with NuGet and should be automatically downloaded upon the first build.

By default, GRA is configured to use LocalDB as a database for development and testing. While not packaged with Visual Studio Community, it can easily be added by selecting the notification flag in the title bar of Visual Studio and choosing to install the "MS SQL Server Update for database tooling". Alternately, the [SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh272686.aspx) package can be installed manually by downloading it from Microsoft.

If you have any trouble getting the package to build, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/MCLD/greatreadingadventure/issues/new) with details.

## Project conventions

The `master` branch represents the latest release and the `develop` branch contains work in progress. For more information see the [OneFlow Git branching model](http://endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow).

- Try to follow the [HTML](http://codeguide.co/#html) and [CSS](http://codeguide.co/#css) code guides.
- Wrap lines at 100 characters whenever possible.
- [`IDisposable`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.idisposable.aspx) calls should be wrapped in [`using()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-statement).
- [`async`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/async-in-depth) methods should have "Async" at the end of the method name.
- Avoid "[magic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming))," place them in constants.
- Avoid adding settings to the `appsettings.json` configuration file, preferences generally belong somewhere that they can be set in the application.
- Review the [project organization](project-organization.md).
- Follow the [initial developer setup](initial-developer-setup.md) guidance.
- Examine guidance for [adding an entity](adding-an-entity.md) if necessary.
- We try to adhere to [domain-driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) with varying levels of success.

## Design/Architecture

### Back-end software
- Development is done in the [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) language.
- Version 4 of the GRA is developed using the [Microsoft .NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) platform using [ASP.NET MVC](https://www.asp.net/mvc).
- Data storage uses the [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) data access technology.

### Front-end user interface

- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
