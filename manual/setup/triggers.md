# Triggers

Triggers allow one action (such as entering a secret code, reaching a certain number of points, or completing a set of challenges or other triggers) to *trigger* another award with a badge and optionally other items (a vendor code, an avatar bundle, a prize, or a certificate).

## Certificates

You can attach a PDF certificate to a Trigger if you have the Trigger Attachment permission in Mission Control. When the customer achieves the necessary criteria to activate the Trigger, they will see a link to the certificate in:

- the pop-up that appears for the user when they activate the Trigger
- their achievement history (shown in the History tab of their My Profile page)
- the Certificates section on their My Profile page
