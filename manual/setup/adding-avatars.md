# Adding avatars

Artwork from the game [Glitch](https://www.glitchthegame.com/) was made freely available under a [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal License](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode) license (essentially a "no rights reserved" license). The artwork used to create in-game characters has been adapted to work with The Great Reading Adventure as the participant's avatar.

## Loading the avatars

You must load the avatars into the software before they can be used.

1. Access **Mission Control** on your installation.
2. Choose the **picture frame icon** from the navigation menu and select "**Avatars**".
3. Click the "**Add default avatars**" button.
4. Wait. **This takes a while**. Make some tea.
5. Navigate through the avatar section of the software and ensure that all of the available assets are agreeable for your program(s) and audience.
6. The `assets` directory can be removed (if desired) once avatars are loaded.
7. Optional: when participants share their avatars via Open Graph markup or Twitter Cards their avatar is placed upon a stage to make it better fit into the image sizes necessary for Open Graph and Twitter: the file named `background.png` in the `assets` directory will be loaded into the GRA as that stage. There are other options in the `backgrounds` folder - if you would like to use one of those just rename the one you select `background.png` and overwrite the current `background.png` file.
