# Getting started

The Great Reading Adventure is a Web application developed with Microsoft ASP.NET 4.0 and Microsoft SQL Server. Currently the GRA only runs in Windows hosting environments with both of those products.

## Hosting it yourself

If your organization has the proper Windows server environment that is accessible from the Internet, hosting on your own systems can be an option.

## Paid hosting

Various providers are available which can host the GRA for a monthly fee.
