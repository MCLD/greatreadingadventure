# Prize Drawings #


There are two parts to running a prize drawing for your library.

The first step is creating the template. Click on the **Drawings** tab, and then select **Drawing Templates**.

At the top of the page you'll see a message stating that the record was saved successfully, but the template is not yet complete.

Enter the number of winners you want to draw, and decide if you want to include previous winners. If you check the **Send Notification** box, a message will automatically go to the winners of the drawing. Uncheck the box if you'd rather contact the winners yourself.

Choose the program (age group) you want, and choose your library. You can also filter by gender or school. Enter your min and max points, and the logging start and end dates. These filters are optional, you can leave them blank if you like. When you are finished, click on the **Save** icon.

The message at the top of the page will tell you that the winners were drawn successfully. You will see the winners' names listed below, along with the option to **Draw Additional** winners. If you want to draw additional winners with the same filters for the same prize, enter the number and click the **Draw** icon again.

Click the **Save** icon to save the results of this Drawing.
