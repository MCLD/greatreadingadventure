# Events #

Events can be used to feature the events at your library. Participants can see the event details, and view the badge that they can earn by entering the secret code they will collect at the event. The Events feature can also be used to create secret codes for multiple uses during your reading program. Want to put a secret code on your check out receipts for redemption throughout your program? Simply create an Event that runs for the length of your program with that secret code.

From the Control Room, click on the **Management** tab. Then click **Events**.

- If using numbers, place them at the beginning or end

Enter the number of points that will be awarded for attending the Event.
