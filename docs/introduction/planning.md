# Planning for initial configuration

## Hosting

As a Web application, the first decision that will need to be made is about hosting. Hosting requirements can be found in the [system requirements](../../installation/system-requirements) section of this manual.

### Self-hosting

If your organization has the proper Windows or Linux server environment that is accessible from the Internet, hosting on your own systems can be an option.

### Paid hosting

Various providers are available which can host the GRA for a monthly fee.

## Programs

Setting up multiple programs gives a library system the flexibility to deliver targeted content to varying audiences, while still unified in the same overall campaign. Libraries have the freedom to customize the content of each program, all so that participants can access audience-appropriate activities, badges, and events. Users can self-select which program to enroll in or the system can automatically place them into an age-appropriate program, based on age or school grade.

Setting up multiple programs adds flexibility but increases complexity.

**In version 4 of the GRA, setting up a single program at the start gives you reading tracking by books (i.e. participants say "I read a book" and get a point). When you select the multi-program initial setup, participants track their reading by minutes read (one minute is one point). You can add and remove programs once you perform the initial setup but you currently cannot change whether you are tracking by books or by minutes read.**

Creating a **single reading program** is good if you:

- Want to track by books read
- Are targeting a single age group
- Intend to have the same experience for all participants
- Aren't intending to require a literacy test for only some participants

**Several age-specific reading programs** are better if you:

- Want to track by minutes read
- Want to report on age groups differently
- Intend to have Badges, Challenges, and Events specific to age groups
