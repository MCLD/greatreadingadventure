# Overview

The Great Reading Adventure (GRA) is a robust, open source software designed to manage library reading programs. The GRA is free to use, modify, and share. We hope you like it and will consider becoming a part of the community.

The GRA was designed to function on computers, tablets, and mobile phones.

Features include:

## Avatars
Engage participants by letting them put together a customized avatar which can easily be shared via social media. The GRA includes almost 4,500 avatar image assets provided under a [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal License](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode) which can be interchanged to create billions of avatar combinations.

## Badges
>“Digital Badges are an assessment and credentialing mechanism that is housed and managed online. Badges are designed to make visible and validate learning in both formal and informal settings and hold the potential to help transform where and how learning is valued.”
>-- MacArthur Foundation

Digital badges are a great way to enhance your reading program. They can be used in addition to (or as a replacement for) physical incentive prizes. Digital badges go far beyond the momentary happiness that a toy incentive provides, as they carry with them recognition of achievement, engagement, and personal identity. The Great Reading Adventure makes it easy to create badges for those who participate in library and other community experiences.

**Here’s how it works:**
* A participant attends a program at your library.
* At the end of the program, you give the participant a secret code for attending.
* The participant enters the secret code into his/her online reading log.
* The participant automatically receives the badge.
Our badge wizard makes the process super simple: you just create an event, upload or design a badge, and assign a secret code. It’s a great new way to tie the online summer reading program to the events in your bricks-and-mortar locations.

## Mail

The Mail facility built-in to the software allows you to engage directly with participants. Individual messages can be submitted which can be handled by any number of back-office staff. Messages are shown as a thread in the administration interface to give context to the conversation. Administrators can also send broadcast messages to all participants.

## Participant management

Participants can be managed by front-line or back-office staff from correcting account registration issues to manually adding or removing points, redeeming prizes, and resetting passwords.

## Triggers

## Questionnaires

You put a lot of time and effort into your summer reading program- it’s important to know that what you’re doing has an impact. The GRA’s comprehensive evaluation tools will help you do just that.

With our pre- and post-testing modules, you can deliver an assessment to participants and compare their scores to their activity during the program. The system auto-scores the multiple choice assessments, which gives you all the data with none of the hassles.

The assessment module doubles as a survey tool, so you can simultaneously gather qualitative and quantitative data to tell a more impactful summer reading story.

## Reporting

With The Great Reading Adventure, immediate access to your program’s vital statistics is just a click away! At-a-glance stats give you a quick breakdown of registrations and completions and in-depth reporting allows you to drill down into the details.

All reports are exportable to HTML and Excel, putting all the summer reading data you need right at your fingertips.
