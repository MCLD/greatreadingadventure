# Planning for initial configuration

## Hosting

As a Web application, the first decision that will need to be made is about hosting. Hosting requirements can be found in the [system requirements](../../installation/system-requirements) section of this manual.

### Self-hosting

If your organization has the proper Windows server environment that is accessible from the Internet, hosting on your own systems can be an option.

### Paid hosting

Various providers are available which can host the GRA for a monthly fee.

## Tenancy

The GRA is scalable to fit the unique needs of any library, system, or consortium. For a single library, the software creates an easy-to-use summer reading program right out of the box. For more complex library systems, such as in the instance of a consortium of libraries participating in the same reading program, multiple tenancy settings expand the software’s scope to allow each participating library to operate individual instances under the consortium’s umbrella. Within each instance, organizations start with a default program designed by a system administrator, which they can then customize as if they were running an independent reading program. The primary benefit of multiple tenancy is centralized setup, administration, and reporting.

Tenancy adds an additional layer of administration to The Great Reading Adventure which also increases the complexity of running the reading program. **We suggest you start out with a single tenant unless you have a compelling reason to configure multi-tenancy or are experienced with the GRA software.**

## Programs

Setting up multiple programs gives a library system the flexibility to deliver targeted content to varying audiences, while still unified in the same overall campaign. Libraries have the freedom to customize the content of each program, all so that participants can access audience-appropriate activities, badges, and events. Users can self-select which program to enroll in or the system can automatically place them into an age-appropriate program, based on age or school grade.

As with tenancy, setting up multiple programs adds flexibility but increases complexity.

Creating a **single reading program** is good if you:

- Are targeting a single age group
- Intend to have the same experience for all participants
- Aren't intending to require a literacy test for only some participants

**Several age-specific reading programs** are better if you:

- Want to report on age groups differently
- Intend to have Adventures, Badges, Challenges, and Events specific to age groups
- Want to allow readers to log their reading differently (e.g. some age groups by minute, some age groups by number of books read).
